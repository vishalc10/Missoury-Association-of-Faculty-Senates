                <p>The
                    <b class="b891">Missouri Association of Faculty Senates</b> (MAFS) is composed of the elected senates, councils, or equivalent
                    groups of the public four-year colleges or universities in the state of Missouri who join. These groups
                    are designated as Associated Senates.</p>
                <p>MAFS began in February of 1993 when twelve faculty senate officers from seven different four-year public
                    colleges and universities met in Jefferson City. Participants resolved to form the Association with the
                    following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strengthening the faculty component of college and university governance.</li>
                    <li>Sharing information, concern, and governance procedures.</li>
                    <li>Providing leadership training for people involved in faculty governance.</li>
                    <li>Working with government agencies for the betterment of higher education.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>A constitution was ratified at the first MAFS Conference at Southwest Missouri State University in June,
                    1993.
